# resurgentNa
This is a version of Indira Raman's MCM resurgent sodium channel in python (source: https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/JP285166)

This model will be expanded upon in our work investigating seasonal changes in the excitability of motor neurons in Gambel's White Crowned Sparrows

Currently this is a simple class for the channel; use run_rsc.py to get a printout
